# Neural Style Transfer Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Neural Style Transfer application, an innovative tool that uses a pretrained VGG-19 model on ImageNet to blend artistic styles with your chosen content images. This guide will walk you through setting up and using the application, ensuring a smooth experience from start to finish.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aimank009/NST
    cd NST
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. **Paste this url on your browser**:
    ```bash
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```
1. **Upload Images**:
    - Upload a style image (e.g., a painting).
    - Upload a content image (e.g., a photograph).

2. **Generate Stylized Image**:
    - Click the "Transfer Style" button.
